# Student-Health-Conditions
## üìå Aims of the Project
In recent years, student health challenges-such as stress, inadequate sleep, poor dietary habits, and mental health issues have become a growing concern worldwide. These factors not only affect well-being but also impact academic success. However, the intricate relationships between these health factors and academic outcomes remain underexplored. 

This project analyzes multiple datasets to uncover connections between student health behaviors and academic performance. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to provide actionable recommendations to improve student well-being and educational outcomes. 

## üèÅ Goal
*  Develop and fine-tune a classification model to analyze correlations between health behaviors (e.g., mental health, physical activity, sleep) and academic performance (e.g., GPA, focus, grades).
*  Identify universal patterns and context-specific trends by examining data from individual, national, and global perspectives.
*  Offer evidence-based strategies to help schools, colleges, and policymakers enhance student success. 

## üîß Methodologies
*  Statistics: Pearson Coefficient, Spearman's Rank Coefficient, Chi-Square Test, visualizations (heatmaps, histograms, boxplots).
*  Machine Learning: Tree-based (Random Forest, XGBoost), KNN, SVMs (Linear, Polynomial, Radial Basis Function).
*  Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Weighted F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.
## Purpose
The primary objectives of this project are: 
 #### 1. Identify Correlations
 Explore the relationships between health behaviors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, mental health) and academic outcomes (e.g., GPA, focus, grades). 
 #### 2. Validate Across Contexts
 Use individual, national, and global datasets to ensure robust, generalizable findings. 
 #### 3. Develop Strategies
 Provide evidence-based insights for schools, colleges, and policymakers to enhance student well-being and performance. 

## üöÄ Possible Outcomes
#### Predictive Model:
   * Accurate classification of students into low, medium, or high health risk levels.
   * Identification of the most effective machine learning models for this task.
 #### Key Insights:
   * Identification of critical health risk factors that impact student well-being and academic performance.
   * Actionable insights for schools and policymakers to target interventions effectively.
 #### Practical Applications:
   * Early intervention programs for schools and colleges.
   * Integration into health monitoring systems for personalized recommendations.
 #### Challenges & Opportunities:
   * Addressing class imbalances, data limitations, and interpretability issues.
   * Ethical considerations, including data privacy and equity.
     
## üí° Project Implications
Ethical considerations are central to this project:
 #### Data Privacy: 
  * Ensure compliance with FERPA and HIPAA by anonymizing datasets.
 #### Equity & Accessibility: 
  * Prevent the misuse of health categorizations to stigmatize students or limit opportunities.
 #### Empowerment: 
  * Use findings to promote healthy decision-making among students through supplemental educational content.

## üéØ Conclusion
#### Positive Impact
  * Informative results to expand student supports and education around the impact of stress and other factors on their health.
 #### Model Comparison
  * By exploring multiple model types, we can see how well each method predicts the classification levels.

### Summary of Project Methodology
This project involves several key methodologies to investigate and answer research questions related to student health risk prediction. The three main areas of focus are **feature selection**, **feature correlation**, and **predictive modeling**.  
#### 1. Feature Selection and Correlation
Feature selection and correlation are closely related, as they share several techniques for identifying the most relevant features in the dataset.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - **Pearson Correlation** ‚Äì Measures linear relationships between numerical variables.  
  - **Spearman‚Äôs Rank Correlation** ‚Äì Captures monotonic relationships, useful for non-linear associations.  
  - **Chi-Square Test** ‚Äì Assesses relationships between categorical variables.  
- **Visualization Tools for Insights:**  
  - **Heatmaps** ‚Äì Displays correlation values in a color-coded matrix.  
  - **Boxplots** ‚Äì Shows the distribution of numerical data across categories.  
  - **Pair Plots** ‚Äì Visualizes relationships between multiple numerical variables.
#### 2. Data Inconsistencies
To ensure accuracy and reliability of the predictive models, it's essential to address data inconsistencies such as outliers and missing values since these can affect model training and lead to inaccurate predictions.
- **Outlier Analysis:**
  - **Detection:** Summary statistics, histograms, boxplots, and interquartile range.
  - **Handling Stretegies:** Remove them, transform them, or cap extreme values to reduce their influence.
- **Missing Values:**
  - **Identify Missing Values:** Summary statistics
  - **Handling Strategies:** Remove intances with missing values, or use imputation.
#### 3. Predictive Modeling  
Predictive modeling is the core component of this project, aiming to accurately classify health risk levels. Some predictive techniques inherently incorporate feature selection.  
- **Models:**  
  - **Tree-Based Models:**  Random Forest and XGBoost.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** 
- **Data Preprocessing for Modeling:**  
  - **Encoding categorical variables** for compatibility with machine learning models.  
  - **Scaling numerical data** to ensure consistency across different scales.
- **Evaluation Metrics for Model Performance:**  
  - **Accuracy** ‚Äì Measures overall correctness of predictions.  
  - **Precision** ‚Äì Assesses how many predicted positive cases are truly positive.  
  - **Recall** ‚Äì Evaluates the model‚Äôs ability to capture actual positive cases.  
  - **Weighted F1-Score** ‚Äì Balances precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.  

By integrating these methods, we aim to develop a robust and well-evaluated predictive model for health risk classification.
