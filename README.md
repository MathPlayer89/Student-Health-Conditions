# Student-Health-Conditions
This project will utilize Python, statistics, and machine learning techniques to identify key factors influencing health risk levels and develop a model to predict them.

### Methods
- Statistics: Pearson Coefficient, Spearman's Rank Coefficient, Chi-Square Test, visualizations (heatmaps, histograms, boxplots).
- Machine Learning: Tree-based (Random Forest, XGBoost), KNN, SVMs (Linear, Polynomial, Radial Basis Function).
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Weighted F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.

### Potential Outcomes
- This project may result in a successful predictive model that classifies students into low, medium, or high health risk levels. By testing different machine learning techniques, the most effective approach for accurate classification can be identified.
- Key health risk factors may also emerge from the analysis. These key features can be instrumental in offering valuable insights into student well-being. Understanding these factors can help inform targeted interventions.
- The findings could have practical applications, such as helping schools implement early intervention programs or guiding policymakers in refining wellness initiatives. If effective, the model could be integrated into student health monitoring systems for personalized recommendations.
- This project could inspire future research with larger datasets or advanced modeling techniques. Integrating real-time health tracking, such as wearable devices, could further enhance student health monitoring and risk prevention.

### Real-World Applications
- By predicting health risk levels, schools can implement targeted intervention programs. This ensures early identification and management of potential health issues, promoting better overall well-being.
- Health departments can use this data to allocate resources like funding, nutritional support, or medical personnel to schools or districts with higher concentrations of ‘high-risk’ students. This leads to a more efficient use of limited public health resources, focusing efforts where they are needed most.
- By understanding patterns in ‘medium’ or ‘high’ health risk groups. Educators can design personalized health education programs tailored to the needs of different risk levels. This enhances the effectiveness of health education, addressing specific concerns like diet, exercise, or mental health.
- Governments and school boards can use predictive models to set evidence-based guidelines for wellness programs, such as implementing healthy meal plans or stress-reduction initiatives. Policies informed by data ensure that programs are both impactful and cost-effective.
