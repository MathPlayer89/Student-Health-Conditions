# Student-Health-Conditions
 This project features analyzing various datasets to uncover the connections and offer evidence-based insights to improve student health and academic performance. This repository includes data visualization, data acquision, and different metrics to evaluate model performance.  
## Features
## Purpose
This project is based on identifying correlations between various health behaviors, such as mental health, physical activity, and sleep, and academic outcomes, such as GPA, focus, and grades.
## Outcomes
This project has the potential to make a positive impact and provide crucial insights on students and organizations. By exploring a variety of different classification models, we hope to discover which models are best at most accurately classifying health risk, but also explore the impact of factors of health risk.
