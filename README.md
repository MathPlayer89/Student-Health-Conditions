# Student-Health-Conditions
This project investigates the intricate relationships between student health behaviors and academic outcomes. Issues like stress, inadequate sleep, poor dietary habits, and mental health challenges are widely recognized, but their specific impacts on academic performance remain underexplored. By analyzing multiple datasets, this project aims to uncover patterns, validate findings across diverse contexts, and provide actionable recommendations to improve student health and academic success.  
## Features
## Purpose
The primary objectives of this project are: 
 #### 1. Identify Correlations
 Explore the relationships between health behaviors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, mental health) and academic outcomes (e.g., GPA, focus, grades). 
 #### 2. Validate Across Contexts
 Use individual, national, and global datasets to ensure robust, generalizable findings. 
 #### 3. Develop Strategies
 Provide evidence-based insights for schools, colleges, and policymakers to enhance student well-being and performance. 
## Outcomes
 #### Predictive Model:
   * Accurate classification of students into low, medium, or high health risk levels.
   * Identification of the most effective machine learning models for this task.
 #### Key Insights:
   * Identification of critical health risk factors that impact student well-being and academic performance.
   * Actionable insights for schools and policymakers to target interventions effectively.
 #### Practical Applications:
   * Early intervention programs for schools and colleges.
   * Integration into health monitoring systems for personalized recommendations.
 #### Challenges & Opportunities:
   * Addressing class imbalances, data limitations, and interpretability issues.
   * Ethical considerations, including data privacy and equity.
## Project Implications
Ethical considerations are central to this project:
 #### Data Privacy: 
  * Ensure compliance with FERPA and HIPAA by anonymizing datasets.
 #### Equity & Accessibility: 
  * Prevent the misuse of health categorizations to stigmatize students or limit opportunities.
 #### Empowerment: 
  * Use findings to promote healthy decision-making among students through supplemental educational content.
